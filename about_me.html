        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p class="about">Dedicated and driven Computer Science undergraduate student with a passion for tackling complex challenges and crafting innovative solutions.
            Currently in the third year of my Bachelor of Science program, I have garnered hands-on experience with a diverse array of programming languages including C++, C#, Java, HTML, CSS, and introductory levels of Javascript and Python.
            Additionally, I am familiar with the SQL language, along with database modeling and designing procedures. Furthermore, I have been introduced to software version control systems like Git and have a foundational understanding of proper software development procedures.
        <br>
        <br>
            Beyond technical proficiency, I bring to the table strong interpersonal skills coupled with a relentless eagerness to learn and adapt.
            Thriving in collaborative environments, I excel at communicating ideas effectively and fostering productive teamwork.
            My problem-solving aptitude, honed through academic projects and extracurricular activities, empowers me to approach obstacles with creativity and resilience.
        <br>
        <br>
            Eager to leverage my multifaceted skill set and passion for technology in an internship role, where I can contribute to meaningful projects while continuing to grow both personally and professionally.
