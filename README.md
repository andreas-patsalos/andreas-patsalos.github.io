A personal website project, created as part of the coursework of my Internet Technologies course.

The website offers a cookie feature, to remember the user the next time they connect and also recognize the browser that they use.

Created in the Webstorm environment, using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The website is hosted on https://dev77cmd.github.io
